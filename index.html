              <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
              <p>Born and raised in the islands, my foundation is built on aloha and doing things the right way. I have lived and traveled the word, from New Zealand to San Francisco, Thailand to Mexico.<br>
                 These experiences have taught me versatility and adaptability in this ever&mdash;changing world.
                 And my work as a web designer is no different. I write clean and elegant code with the end user in mind both on the front and back ends.</p>
              <p>I started out as a self taught bread baker. I saw the need for local, freshly baked bread and took it upon myself to learn. Along with my girlfriend and amazing pastry chef, Sabeth Burad, we founded a microbakery, View Street Bread in Honolulu. After successfully operating the bakery for a year, we decided to move to San Francisco to pursue further learning. I worked as Bread Lead for Jane the Bakery in SF and specialize in sourdough breads, baguettes, and bakery operations.</p>
              <p>We recently moved back to Honolulu, where Sabeth and I are in the process of opening a brick and mortar bakery. The self motivation and energy I put into baking is the same that goes into web design. I am passionate self starter and will bring all I have to your project. After learning the ins and outs of this world, I have dedicated myself to coding and designing websites that are lean, well organized, and easy to maintain. I specialzie in Squarespace websites and highly recommend them for anyone looking to create a beautiful, professional site that is easy to update.</p>
